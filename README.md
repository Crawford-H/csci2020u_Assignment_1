Assignment 1 of Crawford Heidinger and Alessandro Prataveira 


Overview
---------------------------------------------------
Our project uses a mix of java, javafx and css to create a
spam filter. The code then trains itself to determine what emails 
are spam and what emails are ham. We then use test files which are 
already determined to be spam and ham and find out how accurate our
code is in determining whether something is spam or ham.

Improvements
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The basic improvements we made to the UI are adding css which makes the UI cleaner and
easier to read. There are many small features the language adds to a UI that it gives a greater
edge over the regular javafx interface.

How to Run
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to run our program you will need to download a java that is greater than java 8 and less than java 13. You must also get a java that can compile javafx code as well since the regular java versions won't do this. There is a website that you can download a combined version of java and javafx called azul and I would recommened you go there to download it. The recommeneded IDE that we use is Intellij as it is meant for the java coding language and it is easy to setup, but I have gotten the code to work in other IDE's such and visual studio code. Once all the setup is complete and you have everything downloaded, you can clone our repository in your temrinal which is done with a simple git clone and the repository website link. this will import all the code onto your machine for use. Then you are free to play around with our code make changes or just run it for yourself using the built in run button in Intellij!
